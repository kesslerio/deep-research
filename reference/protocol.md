# Research Protocol

## Phase 1: Initial Engagement (STOP POINT)

Before any research begins:
- Ask 2–3 essential clarifying questions.
- Reflect understanding back to the user.
- Wait for response before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Research Planning (STOP POINT)

Present the complete plan to the user:
- Major themes (3–5) with key questions and approach.
- Execution plan with steps, tools, and outputs.
- Expected deliverables, format, and length.

Wait for explicit approval before Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Mandated Research Cycles (NO STOPS)

For each theme, complete two cycles.

### Cycle 1: Landscape Analysis
1. `web_search` broad query (count=20).
2. Synthesize patterns and initial hypotheses.
3. Identify gaps and contradictions.

### Cycle 2: Deep Investigation
1. Targeted `web_search` on gaps.
2. `web_fetch` primary sources.
3. Re-evaluate assumptions; integrate new evidence.

## Required Analysis Between Tool Calls

After each tool call, explicitly:
- Connect new findings to prior results.
- Show how understanding evolved.
- Highlight pattern changes.
- Address contradictions and evidence quality.
- Maintain a coherent narrative thread.

## Tool Usage Sequence

Per theme:
1. Start with `web_search` for landscape.
2. Analyze and identify gaps.
3. `web_fetch` primary sources.
4. Analyze, then repeat with targeted searches.

## Cross-Theme Integration

After all theme cycles:
- Identify shared conclusions.
- Note cross-theme contradictions.
- Map relationships across findings.
- Form a unified understanding.
